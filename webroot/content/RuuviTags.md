# What is a RuuviTag
A RuuviTag is a Open-Source Bluetooth Sensor Beacon, it was a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/463050344/ruuvitag-open-source-bluetooth-sensor-beacon) project.    
The tag is about 5 cm in diameter and with it's sensors you can basically measure the following:

* Temperature
* Relative humidity
* Barometric pressure

# What is planned:
At first I want to compare the data with the data of my [PSA](www.markusgoller.at/weather-station.html).
Since I live in the Alps and there are wonderful mountains around me, I would like to use it to measure the environmental conditions around me.

# Here are a few impressions from the RuuviTag(s):
