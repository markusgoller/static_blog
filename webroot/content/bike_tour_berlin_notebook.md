# Bike tour Berlin

Since my brother and I belong more to the sporty guys, we thought, why shouldn't we explore Berlin by bike.
So we grabbed a rental bike and went for a spin through Berlin.
Since I personally haven't created a jupyter notebook for a while now, I think this is a good opportunity.

### What is planned:
A map with all the routes we have taken this will include the following Python elements:

* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas 
* Basemap
* Matplotlib

The notebook is unfortunately not quite finished yet and will follow.

All in all we were really quite sporty and cycled a good 100 kilometers across Berlin, here are a few impressions from Berlin,
