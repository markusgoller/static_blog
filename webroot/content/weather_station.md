# As a studied atmospheric scientist it is almost a duty to operate a personal weather station [(PWS)](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/IPATSC2/).

Here you can see the outside sensors.

It is a Renkfore radio weather station ["WH2315"](https://www.amazon.de/Renkforce-WH2315-Funk-WETTERSTATION/dp/B01N4DK6TG#ace-g6772571139).
The station has a radio connection to a basis station and this is connected to a Raspberry Pi.
The data is than hosted via [weex](http://www.weewx.com/) to [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/).

Below is a picture of the basis station.

Here you can see a sample screenshot of my PWS taken from Wunderground suitable to the photo above.
